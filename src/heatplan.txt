To do:
-main rpmd code
 --read in 1 mass, fill masses for all lattice sites (may need to put in new flag for this)
 --force estimator to evaluate at each time step in main routine
 --read in templeft and tempright, then calculate betanleft and betanright
 --need width to be declared and read in
-implement potential
 --use natoms to define number of sites
 --implement lattice in potential, where lattice(0) and lattice(N+1) are baths!
 --make harmonic frequencies global, called harm and interharm

Done:
-implement estimator
 --include bath checks
-initial PIMC: use guassians for each lattice site
 --3 gaussians possible: ring polymer, lattice, interatomic
 --generate ring polymer and add to lattice, factor weighted by interatomic

Remember:
-LATTICE STARTS FROM I=2 AND ENDS AT I=NATOM+1
